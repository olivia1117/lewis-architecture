# Lewis Architecture

### Overview
This repository serves as part of the CI/CD pipeline to my Azure static site for creating instructional software architecture for Lewis University. This project is for the requirements of Software Architecture and Design or CPSC 61200. The main purpose of this architecture is to create a more uniform set of tools for students and instructors to use throughout the computer science program. Instead of having students being taught concepts in several different languages and systems that can take more time away from learning the actual topics, this is a potential solution to that. My architecture aims to show students from the beginner level to the more advanced levels skills such as how to create a simple website with HTML and CSS, how to add onto their sites with JavaScript and React, how to host a website through GitHub and Azure using CI/CD techniques, how to integrate a NoSQL database, and more.
